## 2026-03-03 — PLAN-003 (3.2, 3.4) Ship Sprite Integration

**Tasks:** Register new ship art, faction ship sprites in navigation, combat ship sprites
**Model:** Opus 4.6

### New Art Assets

- `design/ships/wolf_ship.png` — Wolf Clans strike craft
- `design/ships/fairy_ship.png` — Fairy Court vessel
- `design/ships/knight_ship.png` — Knight Order warship
- `design/ships/goblin_scrapper.png` — Goblin Syndicate scrapship

### Modified Files

- `engine/sprite_manager.py` — Registered 4 new ship sprites (wolf, fairy, knight, goblin) in
  SHIP_SPRITES registry. Only `alien_craft` remains as a placeholder.
- `__main__.py` — Creates SpriteManager and passes to GameSession.
- `core/session.py` — Accepts `sprite_manager` parameter, stores it, passes to CombatState.
- `ui/navigation.py` — Faction ship sprites rendered at combat POIs (with bobbing animation and
  cutlass sub-icon). Faction inferred from encounter data via `_infer_faction()`. Player ship
  loading refactored to use SpriteManager. Location-to-faction and faction-to-template mappings.
- `ui/combat_ui.py` — Ship sprites replace vector shapes when available. Player sprite (facing
  right) and enemy sprite (flipped left). Vector fallback preserved. Lazy-loaded via
  `_ensure_sprites_loaded()`.
- `systems/combat.py` — Added `ship_template_id` field to `CombatShip` dataclass. Populated
  in both `from_game_ship()` and `from_template()` factory methods.
- `tests/test_sprite_manager.py` — Updated tests: new assets have paths, only `alien_craft`
  is empty. Test count: 26.

### Test Results

- 281 tests, 100% pass rate
- EAL compliance verified (zero pygame imports in core/systems/entities)

## 2026-03-03 — Phase 4 (4.1, 4.1b, 4.3) + PLAN-003 (3.1)

**Tasks:** Music System, SFX System, Ending Summary Screen, Sprite Asset Manager
**Model:** Opus 4.6

### New Files

- `core/music_manager.py` — MusicManager with per-state theme mapping, arc-specific navigation
  themes, SFX event registry, enable/disable controls. Engine-agnostic (uses AudioInterface ABC).
- `engine/sprite_manager.py` — SpriteManager with centralised sprite loading, caching, scaling,
  faction-keyed ship/portrait/character registries, faction colour palettes. Lazy-load with
  graceful fallback to None (callers use vector shapes).
- `tests/test_music_manager.py` — 18 tests covering theme registry, state transitions, arc themes,
  overlay behaviour, SFX triggers, enable/disable, no-audio fallback.
- `tests/test_sprite_manager.py` — 25 tests covering registry completeness, lookup/caching,
  flip/scale, faction colour lookup, preload, cache clearing.
- `tests/test_ending_screen.py` — 18 tests covering ending calculation, summary builder
  (stats, factions, decisions, missions), input handling (scroll, confirm), text wrapping.
- `assets/audio/music/.gitkeep` — Directory for BGM track files
- `assets/audio/sfx/.gitkeep` — Directory for SFX files

### Modified Files

- `core/session.py` — Replaced raw audio event subscriptions with MusicManager. Added
  `music.on_state_change()` at all key transitions (menu, cutscene, navigation, dialogue,
  combat, trade, ending). Wired SFX events through music manager. Arc advancement updates
  navigation theme via `music.on_arc_change()`.
- `ui/ending_screen.py` — Full rewrite: scrollable decision summary with voyage statistics
  (duration, crystals, salvage, encounters, decisions, ship status), faction standings with
  reputation tags (Allied/Friendly/Neutral/Hostile/At War), side mission summary, decision
  history grouped by arc with positive/negative indicators. Arrow key scrolling. Fixed
  `.reputation` → `.reputation_with_player` bug.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `EndingState._calculate_ending()` using non-existent `.reputation` attribute on
  Faction entities (should be `.reputation_with_player`). Same fix in `_build_summary()`.

### Test Results

- All 280 tests pass (210 previous + 70 new)
- All tests run headless without pygame display context
- EAL verification: zero pygame imports in `core/`, `systems/`, `entities/`

## 2026-03-01 — Phase 2: Game Systems

**Tasks:** 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 (PLAN-001)
**Model:** Opus 4.6

### Task 2.1 — Economy System

- Created `systems/economy.py` — crystal extraction, supply routes, market pricing, buy/sell trade
- Added `to_dict()` / `from_dict()` to `CrystalDeposit`, `SupplyRoute`, `CrystalMarket` entities
- Added economy fields to `GameStateData` (crystal_deposits, supply_routes, crystal_market, trade_ledger)
- Updated `GameStateData` serialization for full economy round-trip
- Created `data/economy/economy_data.json` — 6 crystal deposits, 5 supply routes, market config, trade goods
- Added `load_crystal_deposits()`, `load_supply_routes()`, `load_crystal_market()` to `DataLoader`
- Wired `EconomySystem` into `GameSession`
- Created `tests/test_economy.py` — 38 tests covering extraction, discovery, routes, trade, faction economics, serialization

### Task 2.2 — Trade UI

- Created `ui/trade_screen.py` — `TradeScreenState` overlay with buy/sell modes, quantity selection, price display
- Faction-aware pricing with reputation modifiers and trade margin (75% sell/buy ratio)
- Cargo capacity checks, faction reserve limits, trade ledger summary
- Added `open_trade_screen()` to `GameSession` for encounter/dialogue integration

### Task 2.3 — Exploration System

- Created `systems/exploration.py` — `ExplorationSystem` with `Region` and `PointOfInterest` dataclasses
- Region discovery, accessibility, and travel with connected-region validation
- POI discovery via scanning (probability-based), visitation with reward application
- Procedural exploration events with weighted random selection based on region danger
- Full serialization via `get_state_dict()` / `load_state_dict()`
- Created `data/economy/regions.json` — 7 regions with connections, 5 POIs with rewards
- Added `load_regions()`, `load_points_of_interest()` to `DataLoader`
- Created `tests/test_exploration.py` — 16 tests covering regions, travel, POIs, events, serialization

### Task 2.4 — Crew Morale System

- Created `systems/crew_morale.py` — `CrewMoraleSystem` tracking individual and average crew morale
- Morale thresholds: MUTINY (≤20), DISGRUNTLED (≤40), STEADY (≤60), CONTENT (≤80), INSPIRED (>80)
- Combat modifier (0.7x–1.2x) and trade modifier (0.9x–1.1x) based on morale
- Event-driven morale effects: combat victory/defeat, trade outcomes, idle decay
- Faction loyalty checks: crew from hostile factions suffer morale penalties
- Mutiny risk events published when morale drops below threshold
- Created `tests/test_crew_morale.py` — 16 tests covering queries, changes, combat modifiers, loyalty

### Task 2.5 — Faction Conquest AI

- Created `systems/faction_conquest.py` — `FactionConquestAI` with AI-driven faction-vs-faction warfare
- `ConquestAction` dataclass for attack, blockade, diplomacy, and fortify actions
- AI target selection weighted by negative relationships; action type by personality traits
- Resolution: attacks compare military + tactical vs military + stability; blockades reduce reserves
- Diplomacy improves inter-faction relations; fortify boosts military and stability
- Power rankings, threat queries, conflict history tracking
- Created `tests/test_faction_conquest.py` — 8 tests covering planning, all action types, rankings, serialization

### Task 2.6 — Realm Control

- Created `systems/realm_control.py` — `RealmControlSystem` with `RealmState` tracking per-region influence
- Influence-based control: faction with highest influence controls region
- Contested detection when second-place faction has >70% of leader's influence
- Natural drift: home realm influence grows, foreign influence decays
- Conflict result application: winner gains influence, loser loses
- Danger modifiers for contested regions
- Full serialization via `get_state_dict()` / `load_state_dict()`
- Created tests in `test_faction_conquest.py` — 9 tests covering initialization, influence, control changes, territories

### Test Results

## 2026-03-01 — Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

**Tasks:** 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 (PLAN-001)
**Model:** Opus 4.6

### Task 1.1 — Save/Load Manager

- Created `core/save_manager.py` — engine-agnostic save/load system with JSON persistence
- Supports 3 save slots with metadata (character name, arc, playtime, timestamp)

- Pause menu intercepts `Action.PAUSE` from navigation in `GameSession.tick()`
- Load game from menu or pause restores state and relaunches navigation

### Task 1.3 — Pause Menu

- Created `ui/pause_menu.py` — overlay state with Resume / Save / Load / Settings / Quit to Menu
- Quick save to current slot with visual feedback flash
- Follows overlay pattern (semi-transparent background, `machine.pop()` to resume)

### Task 1.4 — Settings Screen

- Created `ui/settings_screen.py` — overlay with music/SFX volume sliders and difficulty toggle
- Settings persisted to `~/.whisper_crystals/settings.json`
- `load_settings()` / `save_settings()` helpers with defaults merging
- Created `tests/test_settings.py` — 5 tests covering round-trip, defaults, corruption, directory creation

## 2026-03-01 — Phase 0: Structural Refactor

**Tasks:** 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 (PLAN-001)
**Model:** Opus 4.6

### Task 0.1 — Extract GameSession from `__main__.py`

- Created `core/session.py` — engine-agnostic `GameSession` class with all callbacks, state transitions, and system orchestration
- Created `core/config.py` — game constants (screen size, FPS, splash duration)
- Created `engine/startup.py` — pygame-specific splash screen and loading frame rendering
- Created `engine/image_utils.py` — centralised pygame image loading and transformation
- Reduced `__main__.py` from 488 lines to 87 lines (pygame init, engine setup, thin main loop)

### Task 0.2 — Separate CombatState UI from combat logic

- Created `ui/combat_ui.py` — CombatState (GameState subclass) with all rendering and interaction
- Stripped `systems/combat.py` to pure logic only: CombatShip, CombatLog, calculate_damage, dodge_chance
- `systems/combat.py` now has zero imports from `core.interfaces` or `core.state_machine`

### Task 0.3 — Fix Engine Abstraction Layer violations

- Added `draw_image()`, `get_image_size()`, `measure_text()` to `RenderInterface` in `core/interfaces.py`
- Implemented all three in `engine/renderer.py` (PygameRenderer)
- Removed `import pygame` from `ui/menu.py`, `ui/navigation.py`, `ui/dialogue_ui.py`, `ui/cutscene.py`
- All UI files now use `RenderInterface` methods exclusively (draw_image, get_image_size, measure_text)
- **Verification:** zero pygame imports in `core/`, `systems/`, `entities/`, `ui/`

### Task 0.4 — Add missing GameStateTypes, remove dead code

- Added `FACTION_SCREEN`, `SHIP_SCREEN`, `SETTINGS` to `GameStateType` enum
- Updated `ui/faction_screen.py` to use `GameStateType.FACTION_SCREEN`
- Updated `ui/ship_screen.py` to use `GameStateType.SHIP_SCREEN`
- Deleted unused `core/game_loop.py`

### Task 0.5 — GameStateData serialization

- Added `to_dict()` / `from_dict()` to `PlayerDecision` and `GameStateData`
- Fixed `Faction.from_dict()` to accept both `reputation_with_player` and `starting_reputation` keys
- Created `tests/test_game_state_serialization.py` — 5 tests covering fresh/modified round-trip, JSON serialization, faction and NPC registry persistence

### Test Results

- All 44 tests pass (27 original + 17 new/modified)
- All tests run headless without pygame display context
